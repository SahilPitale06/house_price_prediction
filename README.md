# House Price Prediction - Regression Model

## Project Overview
This project predicts house prices using linear regression. The dataset provides various features such as the number of rooms, square footage, and neighborhood characteristics to predict the house's selling price.

## Dataset Used
- **Name:** House Prices Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
- **Description:** The dataset contains 80 variables describing the attributes of houses sold.

---

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - Loaded the dataset and identified missing values.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Filled missing values with the median.
   - Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Built a linear regression model using Scikit-learn.
   - Trained and tested the model.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Calculated Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.
   - Saved predictions to a CSV file.

---

## Key Results
- **Model Performance**:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE): *(Add value after running the code)*
  - R² Score: *(Add value after running the code)*

- The model can be further improved by feature selection or using advanced models.
